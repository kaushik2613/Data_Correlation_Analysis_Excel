# Data_Correlation_Analysis_Excel
Focus on sampling real-world data, summarizing it statistically, performing chi-square tests, and documenting the entire process in a report. The aim is to apply statistical methods to real data and interpret meaningful results.


Data Collection: Students will collect two data sets from the real world. Set 1 will be collected
from a large number of observations (at least 100) for a continuous random variable from a
population that is suspected to be Normally distributed. Examples of such data include the body
weight of adult males, the circumferences of oranges, the extension length of rubber bands at the
point at which they burst, etc. Set 2 will be the inter-arrival time of a sequence of 100 or more
events. First, record the actual clock time (to the nearest second, e.g., 2:43:18pm) of each of at
least 100 consecutive events, such as the actual time that a customer enters the post office. Then,
determine the interval between occurrences by taking the difference between successive event
times. Consequently, Set 2 will comprise at least 99 inter-arrival times. You may use 'second' as a
unit of time. You must get the instructor’s permission before collecting data for each project to
ensure your data's relevance, quality, and accuracy.

Descriptive Statistics: For both Sets 1 and 2, use software to do the following:
• Calculate the sample mean and sample standard deviation.
• Calculate the quartiles Q1, Q2, and Q3.
• Construct a box-and-whisker plot.
• Construct a frequency table.
• Construct a frequency histogram.



Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test: Using a Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test with a significance
level of 0.05, test the hypothesis that Set 1 is sampled from a Normal Distribution with a population
mean equal to the sample mean and a population standard deviation equal to the sample standard
deviation. Similarly, test the hypothesis with a significance level of 0.05 that Set 2 is sampled from
an Exponential Distribution with a population mean equal to the sample mean. For each test, please
start with the data classes from your histogram and merge them to ensure each class has a sufficient
number of observations. Then, for each data class, calculate the following:
• Numbers of observations in the data.
• Class probability.
• Class expected value.
• Chi-square component values.
Finally, calculate the chi-square value for each test, describe the degrees of freedom, and explain
your conclusion.

 Goodness-of-Fit Tests: Describe the chi-square tests with tables for the calculated values and
clearly stated conclusions. Show the Excel formulas for your table calculations in an
Appendix.
